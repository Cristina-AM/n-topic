(1, 'What is Productivity?', 'Let\'s define productivity. Productivity is a measure of efficiency of a person completing a task. We often assume that productivity means getting more things done each day. Wrong. Productivity is getting important things done consistently. And no matter what you are working on, there are only a few things that are truly important.\r\n\r\nBeing productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum speed on everything.\r\n\r\nThe original post is here: https://jamesclear.com/productivity', 1, '2019-10-24 18:12:01', 2),
(2, 'Top Productivity Strategies', ' * Eliminate Time Wasting Activities by Using the Eisenhower Box: This simple decision matrix will help you take action, organize tasks, and get more done. The great thing about this matrix is that it can be used for broad productivity plans (â€œHow should I spend my time each week?â€) and for smaller, daily plans (â€œWhat should I do today?â€). \r\n\r\n * Warren Buffettâ€™s â€œ2 Listâ€ Strategy: How to Maximize Your Focus and Master Your Priorities: This method comes from the famous investor Warren Buffett and uses a simple 3-step productivity strategy to help you determine your priorities and actions. You may find this method useful for making decisions and getting yourself to commit to doing one thing right away. \r\n\r\n * The Ivy Lee Method: The Daily Routine Experts Recommend for Peak Productivity: This productivity strategy is straightforward: Do the most important thing first each day. The Ivy Lee Method is a dead simple way to implement this strategy. \r\n\r\n* The 15-Minute Routine Anthony Trollope Used to Write 40+ Books: There is one common problem with the approach of ranking your priorities and doing the most important thing first, though. After ranking your priorities for the day, if the number one task is a really big project then it can leave you feeling frustrated because it takes a long time to finish. Writer Anthony Trollope, however, developed a solution to this common problem. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe original post is here: https://jamesclear.com/productivity\r\n\r\n', 1, '2019-10-24 18:22:50', 2),
(3, 'More Productivity Ideas', '     Most productivity strategies focus on short-term efficiency: how to manage your to-do list effectively, how to get more done each morning, how to shorten your weekly meetings, and so on. These are all reasonable ideas.\r\n\r\n     We often fail to realize, however, that there are certain strategic choices we need to make if we want to maximize our productivity for the long-term. In these articles below, I break down some ideas about long-term productivity.\r\n\r\n          * A Different Way of Thinking About Productivity\r\n          * The Mistake Smart People Make: Being In Motion vs. Taking Action\r\n          * How to Stay Focused When You Get Bored Working Toward Your Goals\r\n \r\nThe original post is here: https://jamesclear.com/productivity', 1, '2019-10-24 23:24:23', 2),
(4, 'Simple Ways to Be More Productive Every Day', 'Step 1: Manage your energy, not your time.\r\nIf you take a moment to think about it, youâ€™ll probably realize that you are better at doing certain tasks at certain times. What type of energy do you have in the morning? Afternoon? Evening? Determine what tasks each energy level and time of day are best suited for.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Prepare the night before.\r\nIf you only do one thing each day then spend a few minutes each night organizing your toâ€“do list for tomorrow. When I do it right, Iâ€™ll outline the article Iâ€™m going to write the next day and develop a short list of the most important items for me to accomplish. It takes 10 minutes that night and saves 3 hours the next day.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Donâ€™t open email until noon.\r\nSounds simple. Nobody does it. It took me awhile to get over the urge to open my inbox, but eventually I realized that everything can wait a few hours. Nobody is going to email you about a true emergency (a death in the family, etc.), so leave your email alone for the first few hours of each day. Use the morning to do whatâ€™s important rather than responding to what is â€œurgent.â€\r\n\r\nStep 4: Turn your phone off and leave it in another room.\r\nOr on your colleague\'s desk. Or at the very least, put it somewhere that is out of sight. This eliminates the urge to check text messages, Facebook, Twitter, and so on. This simple strategy eliminates the likelihood of slipping into halfâ€“work where you waste time dividing your attention among meaningless tasks.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Work in a cool place.\r\nHave you ever noticed how you feel groggy and sluggish in a hot room? Turning the temperature down or moving to a cooler place is an easy way to focus your mind and body. (Hat tip to Michael Hyatt for this one.)\r\n\r\nStep 6: Sit up or stand up.\r\nWhen you sit hunched over, your chest is in a collapsed position and your diaphragm is pressing against the bottom of your lungs, which hinders your ability to breathe easily and deeply. Sit up straight or stand up and youâ€™ll find that you can breathe easier and more fully. As a result, your brain will get more oxygen and youâ€™ll be able to concentrate better.\r\n\r\nStep 7: Develop a â€œpreâ€“game routineâ€ to start your day.\r\nMy morning routine starts by pouring a cold glass of water. Some people kick off their day with ten minutes of meditation. Similarly, you should have a sequence that starts your morning ritual. This tiny routine signals to your brain that itâ€™s time to get into work mode or exercise mode or whatever mode you need to be in to accomplish your task. Additionally, a preâ€“game routine helps you overcome a lack of motivation and get things done even when you donâ€™t feel like it.\r\n\r\nThe original post is here: https://jamesclear.com/productivity', 1, '2019-10-24 23:25:05', 2),

(6, 'What is a bullet Journal?', '      The Bullet Journal is an analog system created by Ryder Carroll, a Designer based in New York. In his words, the Bullet Journal is meant â€œto help you track the past, organize the present, and plan for the future.â€ Itâ€™s an amazing system that keeps a record of everything you could ever want to toss at it. It can be your task manager, sketchbook, journal, idea catcher, and much more!\r\n\r\n     The Bullet Journal is a organizational system in a notebook that keeps track of anything you would like to write down in an coherent way.\r\n\r\nThe original post is here: https://www.tinyrayofsunshine.com/blog/bullet-journal-guide', 2, '2019-10-24 23:35:30', 3),
(7, 'What do you need to get started bullet journalling?  ', '     Mindset\r\n\r\n     First, letâ€™s talk about your motivation for using the Bullet Journal. Most of the people who Bullet Journal tend to do it because itâ€™s a flexible system that lets them work the way that they work.\r\n\r\n     Itâ€™s important to think about what you want a system to do for you before you dive in. That said, youâ€™ll figure out your needs more as time goes on, so get started after youâ€™ve thought about it for a little while.\r\n\r\n     Tools\r\n\r\n     Honestly, any notebook and pen will do. If youâ€™d like to grab one thatâ€™s already set up for the Bullet Journal with an Index and page numbers, then I recommend a Leuchtturm1917 notebook. It is archival quality which means that it will keep what you write in your notebook safe. Options Bullet Journalists really seem to like are:\r\n\r\n     Notebooks\r\n\r\n     Official Bullet Journal Leuchtturm1917 (Definitely highly consider grabbing one of these beauties at some point to thank Ryder for sharing the system with us!)\r\nLeuchtturm1917 (Amazon // GouletPens) (Fountain pen friendly, some show-through)\r\nMoleskine (Show-through and possible bleed-through)\r\nRhodia (Fountain pen friendly, little to no show-through)\r\nEssentials (Little to no show-through, possible bleed-through)\r\nField Notes (Pocket-sized notebooks, possible bleed-through)\r\nClairefontaine (Amazon // GouletPens) (Fountain pen friendly)\r\nMarkings by C.R.

(8, 'Key concepts', '     Indexing, Collections, Rapid-Logging, and Migration make up the foundation of the Bullet Journal.\r\n\r\n     1. Index\r\n     This is the genius of the Bullet Journal.  In order for Indexing to work, you need to number your pages, this way your entries can be added to the Index. The Index is how your organize your entries in your Bullet Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Entries in the Bullet Journal are called Collections.\r\n\r\n     2. Collections\r\n     Every page in the Bullet Journal is given a topic and these topics are referred to as Collections.\r\n\r\n     Every entry in the Bullet Journal is by definition a Collection, regardless of what it looks like.\r\n\r\n     There are 3 main types of Collections that make up the Bullet Journal (Future Log, Monthly Log, and Daily Log):\r\n\r\n     1. Future Log\r\n     This is where you write down events occurring in future months. You can create the layout that makes the most sense to you, the basic iteration is this one:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Also create a blank page to keep Events and Tasks you donâ€™t have a specific date in mind to get to, but want to at some point, such as buying a motorcycle.\r\n\r\n     2. Monthly Log\r\nThe Monthly Log consists of two facing pages, one is the Calendar Page and the other is the Task Page.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Calendar Page\r\n\r\n     Use this to write down your Events and/or add a Note of what happened. The Calendar is laid out this way to give you enough space to write a short snippet of Events you may have going on and also to Note anything you may wish to remember. This will allow you to get a snapshot of what happened.\r\n\r\n     Task Page\r\n\r\n     This list consists of Tasks you want to get done this month and tasks from last month. I will explain the second part of this sentence in a moment.\r\n\r\n     3. Daily Log\r\n     This is the heart of the Bullet Journal. This is used on a day-to-day basis. The date will be the topic. Throughout the course of the day you will rapid-log Tasks, Events, and Notes as they occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n     No worries if you skip a few days here and there. The beauty of the Bullet Journal is that you can pick it up whenever!\r\n\r\n     Other Collections\r\n     Collections are a group of related ideas. Every single page in the Bullet Journal is by definition considered a Collection. This includes the Monthly Log, Daily Log, Future Log, and any page you give a topic to. Every page in the Bullet Journal will have a topic assigned to it, thus every entry you add into your Bullet Journal is a Collection.\r\n\r\n     To reiterate: every entry is considered a Collection.\r\n     For example, a food log, shopping list, meeting notes, and more are all considered Collections.\r\n\r\n     Collections can take any shape or form.\r\n\r\n     Collections can be mindmaps, goal plans, trackers, brainstorming, journaling, sketchnotes, notes, blueprints, design mock-ups, sketches, doodles, ANYTHING. If your mind can conceive it, your notebook can contain it.\r\n\r\n     You can make a drawing on a page and the way youâ€™d add that to the Index is by writing, â€œDrawings: 5, 8-9, 17, â€¦â€\r\n\r\n     Let\'s take a look at some examples of Collections to help you cement the idea that EVERYTHING you could ever want to add into this special notebook system is considered a Collection.\r\n\r\n     Remember, a Collection is a grouping of related ideas, no matter what the form.\r\n\r\n     Collection (List):\r\n     You can make a list of anything! Here I made a list of songs I like. If you recall, in the Daily Log I have these songs with a Note Bullet. I have since Migrated them to a Collection to keep them in one place, as per the Bullet Journal guidelines when you find yourself writing down the same kind of idea over and again in your Daily Logs.\r\n\r\n     Collections can begin organically, however, and do not need to be started in the Daily Logs. You can start a Collection anytime you want to write down related ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Collection (Log):\r\nCollections can be logs of some kind. Here is the Gratitude Log I created to write down 3 things I am thankful for each night, seeing them all in one place makes my heart happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Collection (Notes):\r\n     Collections can be a series of notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Collections (Log & Tracker): \r\n     Collections can take a bit of form and set up according to how you need them. Here I set up a tracker and log hybrid to write down notes about how I feel after my C25K runs.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Collection (Mind-map):\r\n     Collections are free-form by nature, which makes it a perfect place to create mind-maps to connect thoughts.\r\n\r\n     The thing to remember is that at its core, the Bullet Journal is based in a notebook, and because of this reason you can add anything to it and organize it with the Index. Simply begin an idea on a new page, give it a topic (title) and Index it!\r\n\r\n\r\n     Collection (Goal Plans):\r\n     Goals are fun to think about in a notebook. The Bullet Journal allows for a huge amount of flexibility and because of this, you can add ANYTHING to it. Here I wrote out my plan for losing 15lbs, wrote out my motivation (to remind me of why I\'m going for this goal on tougher days), wrote out a S.M.A.R.T. game plan, and color-coded to connect the ideas on how I would follow-through. (Please try to ignore the fact that I misspelled a word...)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Collection (Tracker):\r\n     Simply making an intentional plan isn\'t enough, there needs to some sort of system implemented to help you reach your goals. A tracker is the perfect thing to help you reach your aims! Here\'s a week-by-week tracker related to the goal plan from the last photo.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Collection (Sketches):\r\n     Sometimes you just want to turn the page and sketch. Simply make an entry in your Index called, \"Sketches: 22, 45-49,...\" and add to it to keep track of your Collections that span across several pages. Here are some quick sketches I made.\r\n\r\n\r\n     There are many, many other forms and types of Collections I\'m sure you could come up with! It\'s a notebook, first and foremost, and the blank page is a canvas to create anything you wish! Loosely paraphrasing from Ryder. You fill Collections with short-form notations. In the Bullet Journal, these notations are referred to as Rapid-logging.\r\n\r\n     3. Rapid-logging\r\n     This is the basis of how the Bullet Journal got its name because Rapid-logging consists of Bullets and Signifiers. Rapid-logging is meant to be short-form notation. Rapid-logging consists of 2 parts (Bullets and Signifiers):\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. Bullets\r\nThese are divided into 3 main categories:\r\n\r\n     Task Bullet\r\n\r\nThe Task Bullet is indicated by a dot: â€¢ and it turns into a completed, migrated, scheduled, or cancelled as needed.\r\n\r\n     â€¢ Task - Precedes any Task you write down.\r\n\r\n     X Completed - Once youâ€™ve completed a Task, mark it with a X\r\n\r\n     > Migrated - If you didnâ€™t complete a Task, you Migrate it to another Collection.\r\n\r\n     < Scheduled - Tasks with specific dates in the future. These can be added to the Future Log.\r\n\r\n     Examples:\r\n          â€¢ Wash clothes\r\n          â€¢ Clear gutter\r\n          â€¢ Math hw ch5 probs 62-90 (odd)\r\n          X Buy groceries\r\n          X Shine shoes\r\n          X Ask for a raise\r\n          >  Pick up mail\r\n          >  Buy shoes\r\n          >  Call Joan\r\n          < Visit to the Vet, Sep 16\r\n          < Begin budgeting for Anniversary present, June 4\r\n          < CL, March\r\n\r\n     Event Bullet\r\n\r\n     Indicated by an open circle: O. These are date-specific. You would add them to the according Collections: Future Log, Monthly Log, and Daily Log. Sometimes other Collections if you need to, for example as part of a project planning Collection.\r\n\r\n     Examples:\r\n          O Run\r\n          O Meeting at 2pm\r\n          O 10am Calc\r\n\r\n     Note Bullet\r\n\r\n     Indicated by a dash: -. These are Notes that you want to remember such as ideas, observations, thoughts, and facts.\r\n\r\n     Examples:\r\n          - Night terrors of 1927: Perfect day\r\n          - Timer bubble bath\r\n          - Got to see AndyAna Jones!\r\n\r\n     2. Signifiers\r\n     Signifiers add extra context to the Bullet Journal. This helps you to see at a glance what the Bullets represent. You do not need to add a Signifier to each Bullet, only the ones youâ€™d like to have more information about stand out. You place these to the left of the Bullets.\r\n\r\n     Here are some examples:\r\n          * = Priority\r\n          ðŸ‘â€ðŸ—¨- Explore\r\n          ! - Inspiration.\r\n\r\n     Examples of how you combine Signifiers with Bullets:\r\n          $ â€¢ Buy ink\r\n          * O 9AM phone call\r\n\r\n     You can create your own Bullets and Signifiers as you see fit. For example, you can use a checkbox instead of a dot for a Task.\r\n\r\n     Rapid-logging occurs throughout the entire Bullet Journal in Collections (this includes the Month Log, Daily Log, Future Log, and other Collections) by using the Bullets to jot down short snippets and Signifiers to add more context if needed. You do not need to use a Signifier with every Bullet, only add them to the ones you would like more information from at a glance.\r\n\r\n     Review is key to keeping up with any system. In the Bullet Journal, there is a regular type of review process called Migration.\r\n\r\n     4. Migration\r\n     Migration is the cornerstone of the Bullet Journal. Another way you could think of Migration is active reviewing.\r\n\r\n     Migration is the act of moving over undoneTasks over to another Collection. You can also Schedule Events and Tasks to the Future Log is they will be occurring at another time.\r\n\r\n     Migration is done at the end of the month when preparing the next Month Log. You look over the undone Tasks from your Collections and assess each one and Migrate the ones you still want to do over to the new Month Log. If there are Tasks you no longer want to do, cross them out. If there are Tasks and Events you want to Schedule to another month, add those to the Future Log.\r\n\r\n     Next, Migrate Scheduled Events and Tasks from the Future Log to the new Month Log.\r\n\r\n     You now know the framework of the Bullet Journal (Index, Collections, Rapid-logging, and Migration), now how do you apply them?\r\n\r\nThe original post is here: https://www.tinyrayofsunshine.com/blog/bullet-journal-guide\r\n\r\n', 2, '2019-10-24 23:53:47', 3),
(9, 'Putting the pieces together', '     * When you create Collection, you add it to the Index.\r\n     *  You Rapid-log with Bullets & add Signifiers to the left of Bullets as needed.\r\n     * You Migrate Tasks between Collections as needed and on a monthly basis. At the end of the month, look over through all of your Collections (This includes the Monthly and Daily Logs) to assess whether they are worth doing. If they are worth doing, Migrate them to the new Monthly Log. If they are not worth doing then cross them out, remove the noise. If they are worth doing, but at some other point in time, Schedule them in the Future Log (either in a specific month or in a blank Future Log page).\r\n\r\nThe original post is here: https://www.tinyrayofsunshine.com/blog/bullet-journal-guide', 2, '2019-10-24 23:55:27', 3),
(10, 'The best films of 2019 (so far)', '     It\'s been a big year for comic book movies, but there are plenty of other great films to catch up on too. Here are some of the best\r\n\r\n     Vice\r\n\r\nDirector Adam McKay\'s follow-up to the roaring success of The Big Short is a similarly comedic biopic based on the life of Dick Cheney, dubbed the most powerful Vice President ever. Christian Bale plays Cheney opposite Amy Adams, who plays his formidable political partner and wife. It\'s a darkly funny, nihilistic take on a traumatic period of history, which earned a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.\r\n\r\n     Bait\r\n\r\n     You\'re unlikely to have seen many (or any) films that resemble Bait. It\'s a feature that\'s at first bewildering â€“ yet immediately thrilling â€“ in its abrupt, sparse, experimental style. It focuses on a small Cornish fishing village, and the fraying relations between locals and the aggressively middle class Londoners eager to colonise it. It\'s a quiet film, but one that thrums with a a primal rawness. Hailed by the Guardian as the \'defining film of the decade\', director Mark Jenkins is surely destined for great things.\r\n\r\n     Burning\r\n\r\nAn astonishing dreamlike masterpiece based on a short story by Haruki Murakmi, written and directed by Lee Chang-dong. Set near the border between South and North Korea, a young man named Lee Jong-su strikes up a romance with a girl. She leaves to go travelling and returns with a richer more worldly boy, played by the Walking Deadâ€™s Steven Yeun. He tells Lee Jong-su that sometimes he goes out into Koreaâ€™s countryside, finds a greenhouse and burns it down. This fact steadily drives Lee Jong-su into a deeper and deeper paranoia, and the film transforms into a harrowing mystery.\r\n\r\n     Detective Pikachu\r\n\r\nDetective Pikachu only exists because of the success of PokÃ©mon Go â€“ the hit location and augmented reality game launched in July 2016. The live-action PokÃ©mon film stars Ryan Reynolds as the voice of the electric character, with an accompanying deerstalker hat. There are perhaps one too many twists in the tale, but it\'s an easy-to-watch fun, family-oriented film. It also did surprisingly well at the box office, becoming one of the biggest gaming-related movies of all time.\r\n\r\n     Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\r\n\r\nFor his latest film, Quentin Tarantino went big - although arguably, he usually does. His cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt as two aspiring TV stars hoping to succeed in the film industry in 1969 Los Angeles. The film is set in the context of an America rocked by the Manson Family murders - the killings perpetrated by a cult formed in California and led by Charles Manson. By the end of the 60s, Manson was predicting an apocalyptic war based on racial tensions. Hyper violence and a cult of deranged leaders: it is not hard to see how it all makes for a classic Tarantino.\r\n\r\n     The Favourite\r\n\r\nWe\'re cheating a little here. Strictly speaking, The Favourite came out on December 26, 2018 in the UK, but we\'re calling it 2019 due to proximity. Olivia Colman won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Queen Anne, isolated and manipulated by Lady Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz) and her younger cousin Abigail Hill (Emma Stone). It\'s a darkly comic psychological drama with a loose relationship to the truth, but it\'s all the more entertaining for the license it takes.\r\n\r\n     Us\r\n\r\n     Jordan Peele returns with another horror derived from life in America â€“ this time a family is stalked by their evil doppelgangers. â€œStructured like a home-invasion drama, â€˜Usâ€™ is a horror filmâ€”though saying so is like offering a reminder that â€œThe Godfatherâ€ is a gangster film or that â€œ2001: A Space Odysseyâ€ is science fiction,â€ says the New Yorkerâ€™s Richard Brody. Fans of Get Out will find lots to love here, though Us is the less funny of the pair.\r\n\r\n     John Wick: Chapter 3 â€“ Parabellum\r\n\r\n     Guns. The third outing in the cult action John Wick series sees Keanu Reeves joined by Halle Berry, playing a fellow assassin and friend, and Laurence Fishburne as an underground crime lord. In this installment, Wick has a $14 million price on his head and a massive gang of angry assassin types trying to kill him. In other words, it\'s classic John Wick and it\'s great fun.\r\n\r\n     Avengers: Endgame\r\n\r\n     Was it perfect? No. Was it an incredible conclusion to more than ten years of interconnected movies? Absolutely. Directors the Russo Brothers adeptly juggle the plot strands of Marvel\'s epic, which keeps you hooked despite its epic run time of over three hours. There\'s so much in the film, it\'s bound to reward repeat viewing.\r\n\r\n      Annihilation\r\n\r\n     Alex Garland of Ex Machina and The Beach fame adapts one of the best sci-fi books of the past 10 years, Jeff VanderMeerâ€™s Annihilation. This adaptation was criminally underseen on its release, going straight to Netflix, but itâ€™s actually excellent â€“ Natalie Portman is great and it makes several changes to the book that fans will appreciate. â€œAnnihilation is more than mere visuals and it will shock, fascinate and haunt audiences, whatever screen itâ€™s watched on,â€ says Benjamin Lee at The Guardian.\r\n\r\n     Border\r\n\r\n     A bizarre but brilliant film about a literal troll who works as a border security agent, due to her inhuman sense of smell (she can sniff out emotions). From the same writer as vampire child classic Let the Right One In, Border has the same mix of cruel realism and violent fantasy. \r\n\r\n     Captain Marvel\r\n\r\n     Had Marvel realised quite how popular Captain Marvel would be, it might have featured the character more prominently in its other big movie this year. Still, it\'s churlish to complain given we did get Captain Marvel and it was outstanding. Brie Larson nails the title role and it\'s great to see Samuel L. Jackson, skilfully de-aged for the 70s setting, getting a little more to do in a Marvel movie.\r\n\r\n     Booksmart\r\n\r\n     Teenage coming of age comedy about a party before the protagonists go off to college! Sound familiar? Starring Jonah Hillâ€™s sister, this is like a much better, more diversely represented Superbad. â€œThe screenwriters donâ€™t so much reinvent the formula as refresh it, infusing some familiar situations with an exuberant, generous, matter-of-factly feminist sensibility,â€ says A.O. Scott at the New York Times.\r\n\r\n     Ash is Purest White\r\n\r\n     An epic, sprawling gangster movie set in an industrial city in China, in which a young dancer named falls in love with a mobster. He goes to jail and she enacts revenge. â€œAs the country undergoes social, political, economic and ecological transformation, he asks how an old model of being can survive, suggesting that the jianghu, or outlaw, spirit might be the thing that persists,â€ says The Guardianâ€™s Simran Hans.\r\n\r\n     Can You Ever Forgive Me?\r\n\r\n     Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant both earned Academy nominations for their roles in Can You Ever Forgive Me?, a low-key biography of Lee Israel (McCarthy), a writer who in desperation resorts to forging letters from dead authors and playwrights. It didn\'t win big at the box office, making just short of $12m on a budget of $10m, but it\'s a great film where McCarthy proves she has serious acting chops beyond comedy.\r\n\r\n     Toy Story 4\r\n\r\n     Buzz Lightyear first appeared in Andy\'s toy collection in 1995. Now, almost 25 years later the fourth instalment of Toy Story is out and it\'s another huge hit. Buzz, Woody, Mr Potato Head and the rest of the toys are now in the possession of new owner Bonnie. When Bonnie adds a reluctant new toy called â€œForkyâ€ to her room, Woody and his new friends have to go on a road trip adventure.\r\n\r\n     Spider-Man: Far From Home\r\n\r\n     A sequel to 2017\'s Homecoming, Far From Home is set after Avengers: Endgame, and sees Peter Parker go on a school trip to Europe with his friends. When he\'s abroad though, he has to team up with Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) to battle four extradimensional humanoids called the Elementals. It also sets the scene for the future of the Marvel series after the events of Endgame. Like the first film, Holland nails the lead role and the final act lifts a good film to a great one.\r\n\r\n     Midsommar\r\n\r\n     Ari Asterâ€™s Hereditary, which came out last year, was a rare thing: a genuinely terrifying, critically acclaimed horror film. His latest, Midsommar, stars Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor as a young couple on holiday in a Swedish village. They attend a festival that only happens every 90 years, which initially seems idyllic, until (you guessed it) the party descends into cultish violence.\r\n\r\n     High Life\r\n\r\n     Monte (Robert Pattison) and his baby daughter are the last survivors of a mission to the outer reaches of the solar system, but theyâ€™re hurtling towards a black hole. This sounds like a standard sci fi action movie, but itâ€™s actually a high art masterpiece. â€œAn Old Testament parable catapulted forward into the 23rd century, a primal scene in a pressurised cabin of sci-fi pessimism, suppressed horror and denied panic,â€ says The Guardianâ€™s Peter Bradshaw.\r\n\r\nThe original post is here: https://www.wired.co.uk/article/best-films-2019', 1, '2019-10-25 00:22:49', 4),
(11, 'The new PC games of 2019', '     Autumn has landed, which means that whatever it is your life entails: School, work, or rehabilitating your inherited family farm, you\'re likely juggling playtime between at least two newly released PC games. Highly anticipated games both big and small are coming out every week, and the trend is forecasted to continue as the year comes to a close. Make sure you don\'t miss a release with our helpful guide to the new games of 2019.\r\n\r\n     Weâ€™ve organized our massive guide to upcoming 2019 PC games by the month theyâ€™re coming out. For the games that donâ€™t have a release date yet (and thereâ€™s a ton of them), check out the TBA page. We\'re constantly updating this guide with new games and release dates, so make sure to check back often. Looking for something to play right now? Then check out our guide to the best PC games or the best free games on Steam. And to make them really shine, check out our roundup of the best graphics cards.\r\n\r\n     On this first page we\'ve listed out the new games coming to PC in October 2019 that you should keep an eye on. And below October\'s games, you\'ll find a quick guide to the biggest games still coming in 2019 from Doom Eternal to Hollow Knight: Silksong.\r\n\r\n          November\r\n          December\r\n          TBA\r\n\r\n     Games of October 2019\r\nWarsaw\r\n\r\n     October 2 | Pixelated Milk | Link | Tactics RPG\r\n     This 2D turn-based WWII tactics game calls to mind the likes of Darkest Dungeon, with a management angle that resembles This War of Mine. Rather than hardened soldiers, youâ€™ll play as a far more ragtag group, sending out scouting groups and scrounging up supplies from Nazi, and recruiting more friends who want a piece of the action.\r\n\r\n     Neo Cab\r\n\r\n     October 3 | Chance Agency | Link | Adventure\r\n     Being an Uber driver in the future is hell, just like the present. As the last human driver around, youâ€™ll ferry around the odd citizens of a neon-soaked city while also searching for your lost friend, who just so happens is being hunted by the mega-corporation that runs the place. Gig labor is the big topic being addressed here, as gameplay seemingly blends elements of VA-11 HALL-A and Papers, Please to illustrate just how tough it is to make a buck when your job depends on positive ratings.\r\n\r\n     Ghost Recon Breakpoint\r\n\r\n     October 4 | Ubisoft | Link | Third-Person Shooter\r\n\r\n     Ubisoft promises that Breakpoint will be more about survival than overwhelming firepower, but I donâ€™t know. Sure looks like a lot of run-and-gunning as you and your squad fight to reclaim a fictional island from Jon Bernthal (playing an ex-Ghost operative) and his bad guy crew, this time with 300% more drones. Read Andy Kâ€™s preview. \r\n\r\n     Trine 4\r\n\r\n     October 8 | Frozenbyte | Link | Puzzle Platformer\r\n\r\n     After dabbling in 3D puzzle platforming in Trine 3, Frozenbyte is returning to the expected 2.5D platforming of the series\' past with Trine 4. The basics are the same as everâ€”trouble in the realm that the heroes of the Trine must work together to resolveâ€”but the characters themselves have been upgraded somewhat: Pontius the Knight can conjure Ghost Shields, for instance, while Zoya the Entrepreneur now has access to Elemental Arrows, and Amadeus the Wizard has added balls to his repertoire. As ever, Trine 4 will allow solo or co-op play. This time around, Trine 4 will even offer a 4-player co-op mode that allows for multiple of each character to be played if you choose.\r\n\r\n     Indivisible\r\n\r\n     October 8| Lab Zero Games | Link | Action Platformer\r\nAfter a rebellious young girlâ€™s home is attacked and an ancient power awakens inside her, she must absorb the â€œIncarnationsâ€ of people she meets along the way to aid her journey. Side-scrolling platforming and party-based combat set in a hand-drawn 2D world will keep you busy while you reunite the land.\r\n\r\n     Valfaris\r\n\r\n     October 10 | Steel Mantis | Link | Metroidvania Shooter\r\n\r\n     Everything, literally everything about Valfaris screams metal, with a dash of Warhammer space marines. Even the developer, Steel Mantis, sounds like something youâ€™d see opening up for Cannibal Corpse. Youâ€™ll shoot, burn, and generally gore your way through a doomed fortress filled with mechs, skulls, and a mech with a skull for a face. The soundtrack is composed by one of the guitarists from Celtic Frost too, so hell yeah.\r\n\r\n     Grid\r\n\r\n     October 11 | Codemasters | Link | Racing\r\n\r\n     Codemasters return to the Grid racing series is looking beautiful. Originally slated for September, Codemasters decided to push it back to October 11. Apparently, the delay has nothing to do with development issues, Codemasters simply wants more time to promote the game before launch.\r\n\r\n     Disco Elysium\r\n\r\n     October 15 | ZA/UM | Link | RPG\r\n\r\n     The announce date for this strange RPG was announced out of nowhere, and it\'s coming really soon. Disco Elysium is a detective RPG where your skills literally talk to you to chime in with advice about the case. As an amnesiac detective, you\'re literally rebuilding your personality as you level up, allowing your choice and skills to dictate who you become.\r\n\r\n     Chernobylite\r\n\r\n     October 16 | The Farm 51 | Link | Survival RPG\r\n     Itâ€™s unlikely that Chernobylâ€™s spooky Exclusion Zone will ever go out of style, so Chernobylite tosses you back in as a former power plant physicist to find your long lost wife. The Farm 51 evidently 3D scanned the entire area, so thereâ€™s some level of realism amidst all the extradimensional monsters hunting you. Thankfully, you can do some hunting too alongside fellow stalkers, but theyâ€™ll just as quickly stab you in the back if it gets hairy.\r\n\r\n     The Outer Worlds\r\n\r\n     October 25 | Obsidian Entertainment | Link | RPG\r\nâ€œFrom the original creators of Falloutâ€ indeed. Shade aside, Obsidianâ€™s RPG chops are on full display in this first-person Firefly-esque world of mad scientists, space cowboys, upbeat music, and the occasionally morbid humor of Fallout designer Tim Cain. Check out our in-depth interview with him and fellow co-director Leonard Boyarsky. For all your other questions about The Outer Worlds, check out our list of everything we know about it.\r\n\r\n     Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\r\n\r\n     October 25 | Infinity Ward | Link | FPS\r\nYou know it. We know it. We\'re getting another COD this year. What we didn\'t expect, especially after the solid success of Black Ops 4\'s \"Blackout\" battle royale mode, was the return of a campaign mode. \r\n\r\n     Bleeding Edge\r\n\r\n     October 25 | Ninja Theory | Link | Hero Brawler\r\n     Known for their games with incredible melee and sword-slinging combat, Ninja Theory is ditching their recent grimdark vibes for something much more bouncy and colorful. Itâ€™s a 4v4 co-op melee brawler with some serious Overwatch-ish hero designs. You can try it on Games Pass later this year, but check our thoughts first.\r\n\r\n     Afterparty\r\n\r\n     October 29 | Night School Studio | Link | Adventure\r\n     The Oxenfree team is going to Hell, and theyâ€™re going to drink Satan under the table. More specifically, two best buddies named Milo and Lola will be challenging the dark lord, who grants anyone who can beat him in a drinking competition re-entry back to Earth. Youâ€™ll explore the outer rings of the underworld, choosing from dialogue options to affect the relationship between the two, drink mysterious concoctions for power-ups and extra dialogue options, and partake in a round of beer pong or karaoke.\r\n\r\n     The biggest games still coming in 2019\r\nHalo Master Chief Collection\r\n\r\n     TBA | 343 Industries | Link | Shooter\r\n     Despite a disastrous launch, the Master Chief Collection slowly became a definitive gathering of Halo games, made playable on newer hardware. And it\'s finally coming to PC. 343 Industries says itâ€™s all coming in stages, with Reach, then Halo 1, and chronologically on from there with community input being taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n     MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries\r\n\r\n     December 10 | Piranha Games | Link | Action\r\nIf you, like us, have been waiting 17 years for a new singleplayer MechWarrior campaign, this will be a huge deal in 2019. MechWarrior 5 will let you explore and liberate apparently hundreds of planets from enemy strongholds, fully customising your mech along the way. \r\n\r\n     Hollow Knight: Silksong\r\n\r\n     TBA | Team Cherry | Link | Metroidvania\r\n     What started as DLC for Hollow Knight, starring Hornet as a playable character, apparently could not be contained. It\'s become a full game, a sequel to Hollow Knight, with a new setting, 150+ new enemies, a quest system, and doubtless much more. Whereas Hollow Knight was about descending deeper into the depths of Hallownest, this game will see Hornet climbing through a new kingdom to reach a peak. Team Cherry haven\'t mentioned a release date, but seem to be well into the game from what they\'ve shown.\r\n\r\nRead the full post here: https://www.pcgamer.com/new-games-2019/', 1, '2019-10-25 00:33:44', 4),
(12, 'Healthy Lifestyle Tips', '     WHAT IS A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE?\r\n\r\n     A healthy lifestyle is one which helps to keep and improve your health and well-being. There are many different things that you can do to live a healthy lifestyle, such as eating healthy, being physically active, maintaining a healthy weigh, and managing your stress. However, a healthy lifestyle isnâ€™t just about healthy eating and exercise, it also about taking care of the â€œwhole youâ€ â€“ your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. And, that means taking care of you from the inside out.\r\n\r\n     HOW TO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE\r\n\r\n     Even though there are many common ways to live a healthy lifestyle, actually doing it looks different for everyone, and means something different from one person to the next. Regardless of what you choose to do, living a healthy lifestyle is a key component to disease prevention, wellness, and longevity.\r\n\r\n     Being mindful of your diet, physical activity and stress levels allows you to effectively balance all aspects of your life and the â€œwhole youâ€. Below are 10 important things you can do to live a healthy lifestyle:\r\n\r\n     Healthy Lifestyle    \r\n\r\n     Drink more water. Most of us donâ€™t drink enough water every day. Water is essential for our body to function. Did you know that over 60% of our body is made up of water? Water is needed to carry out body functions, remove waste, and carry nutrients and oxygen around our body. Since we lose water every day through urine, bowel movements, perspiration and breathing, we need to replenish our water intake. Since food intake contributes about 20% of our fluid intake, that means we need to drink about 8-10 glasses a day to stay hydrated.\r\n\r\n     One way to tell if youâ€™re hydrated â€” your urine should be colorless or slightly yellow. If itâ€™s not, youâ€™re not getting enough water! Other signs include: Dry lips, dry mouth, and little urination.\r\n\r\n     Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep may lead to a host of health problems including obesity, diabetes, and even heart disease. Continued lack of sleep can affect your immune system and make you less able to fend off colds and the flu. So, itâ€™s important go get a good nightâ€™s sleep.\r\n\r\n     You can do things to help you sleep better at night. You can avoid stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine close to bedtime. Also, while alcohol is well-known to help you fall asleep faster, too much close to bedtime can disrupt sleep in the second half of the night as the body begins to process the alcohol.\r\n\r\n     Exercise can also help you sleep better at night. As little as 10 minutes of aerobic exercise, such as walking or cycling, can drastically improve nighttime sleep quality but please avoid strenuous workouts close to bedtime.\r\n\r\n     Meditate often. Meditation quietens your mind and calms your soul. It can also help you deal with and manage the stress in your life. If you donâ€™t know how to meditate, you can learn how to meditate in 5 simple steps.\r\n\r\n     Exercise regularly. If you can exercise donâ€™t just a few times a week, but every day. Movement is key to a healthy life. Exercising daily can improve your health in many ways. It can help increase your life span, lower your risk of diseases, help you develop higher bone density, and lose weight.\r\n\r\n     One simple thing you can do is, especially for close distances, choose walking over riding, driving or taking transportation. You can climb the stairs instead of taking the elevator. You can pick exercises that are easy to do at home or outside that you enjoy. When you enjoy the physically activities you choose for yourself, most likely youâ€™ll enjoy them and naturally want to do them. Exercise is about being healthy and having fun at the same time. Also, mixing up your exercises will keep them interesting.\r\n\r\n     Eat more fruits and vegetables. Fruits contain lots of vitamins and minerals. As much as possible, you should consume your vitamins and minerals via your daily diet. Satisfy your palate with these nutritious fruits: Watermelon, Apricots, Avocado (yes, avocado is technically a fruit!), Apple, Cantaloupe, Grapefruit, Kiwi, Guava, Papaya, Strawberries.\r\n\r\n     Like fruits, vegetables are important for good health. Experts suggest 5-9 servings of fruits/vegetables a day, but unfortunately it may be difficult at times. However, when you can, include foods like kidney beans, black beans, asparagus, long beans, green beans, and carrots. Think about your favorite vegetables and how you can include more of them in your diet every day, and pick bright-colored foods. Fruits and vegetables with bright colors are good for health because they remove the things in our body that damage our cells. So, get your fill of fruits/vegetables of different colors: White (Bananas, Mushroom), Yellow (Pineapples, Mango), Orange (Orange, Papaya), Red (Apple, Strawberries, Tomatoes, Watermelon), Green (Guava, Avocados, Cucumber, Lettuce, Celery), Purple/Blue (Blackberries, Eggplant, Prunes).\r\n\r\n     Cut down on processed food. Processed foods are not good because (1) most nutritional value is lost in the making of these foods and (2) the added preservatives are bad for our health. Many processed foods contain a high amount of salt content, which leads to higher blood pressure and heart disease. Processed foods are anything that is not in its raw form. In general, most food in supermarkets are processed â€” the more ingredients it has on the label (especially the ones ending with â€˜iteâ€™ or â€˜ateâ€™), the more processed they are. Watch out for those with salt/sugar in the first 5 ingredients and go for unprocessed food as much as possible.\r\n\r\n     Breathe deeply on purpose. Oxygen is a vital source of life. You may know how to breathe, but are you breathing properly? Most of us donâ€™t breathe properly â€” we take only shallow breaths and breathe to 1/3 of our lung capacity. A full breath is one where your lungs are completely filled, your abdomen expands, and thereâ€™s minimum movement in your shoulders. There are many benefits of deep breathingwhich include a reduction in stress and blood pressure, strengthening of abdominal and intestinal muscles and relief of general body aches and pains. Deep breathing also helps with better blood flow, releasing toxins from the body, and aids in getting a better nightâ€™s sleep.\r\n\r\n     Go for brown carbs vs. white carbs. White carbsare refined grains like white rice, pasta, white bread, crackers, noodles, tortillas, wraps, anything with white flour and breading. The nutrients have been removed in the production process, leaving them rich in calories but low in nutrients. They also cause unhealthy spikes in our sugar levels. Go for brown carbs (unrefined complex carbs) instead, like brown rice, whole grain, oats, oatmeal (not the instant kind), and legumes. These come with nutrients and vitamins intact.\r\n\r\n     Cut down on oily and sugary food, soda and caffeine. If possible, reduce your intake of fast food, French fries, doughnuts, chips, wedges, and deep-fried food. Not only are they very fattening (1 tablespoon of oil is 120 calories), deep fried food contains acrylamide, a potential cancer-causing chemical. There are better alternatives, such as grilled, steamed, stir-fried, or even raw food.\r\n\r\n     Cutting down on sugary food is better for your health as well. These are things such as candy bars, pastries, chocolate, cookies, cakes, and jelly donuts. Not only do they not fill you up, they cause you to want to eat more due to the sugar rush. Go for healthy snacks instead like fruits, salads, pure juices, and unprocessed foods.\r\n\r\n     Drinks with caffeine are diuretics, meaning they speed up the rate of urine production. This means they donâ€™t hydrate you as well as plain water can. Also, soda is unhealthy, causes weight gain, and is an artificial stimulant. Replace your soda with water or vegetable juices instead. Learn more at 5 Reasons To Quit Soda (And How to Do It)\r\n\r\n     Stop smoking and/or avoid passive smoking. Smoking can severely increase your risk of lung cancer, kidney cancer, esophageal cancer, heart attack, and more. Smoking â€œlightâ€ cigarettes do not decrease health risks either. If you do smoke, stop now and do it not only for yourself but also your family and friends.\r\n\r\n     Second hand smoking (breathing in air from smokers) can cause many of the same long-term diseases as direct smoking. There is no risk-free level of passive smoking; even brief exposure can be harmful to your health. If possible, stay away from smokers and avoid cigarette smoke where you can.\r\n\r\nOriginal post here: http://www.livehealthyoc.me/healthy-lifestyle-tips/', 1, '2019-10-25 00:44:21', 1);
